# Air travel analysis
# We have a 1% sample of all air legs flown in Q2 2022. We will use this to derive
# basic information about air flows in the US.

# This data is extracted from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics DB1B dataset

library(tidyverse)

# first, we need to load the data
data = read_csv("data/air_sample.csv")

# I always like to look at a sample of my data to see what I'm dealing with
data[1:10, ]

# The data have seven columns: origin and destination airport, origin and destination cities
# carrier, and distance. The city and carrier are coded, so we will merge in other
# (the airports have codes as well, but these are fairly well known - e.g. RDU is
# Raleigh-Durham and LAX is Los Angeles; we won't match those with the official airport
# names)

# This may be misleading, however, as some metropolitan areas have only one airport
# (for example, Raleigh-Durham or Las Vegas), while others have more (for example,
# New York or Los Angeles). We can repeat the analysis grouping by "market", which
